A GitHub action for installing [fish shell](https://fishshell.com).

<hr>

## Prerequisites

This action has a few dependencies that are generally satisfied by most [GitHub-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners) (`macos-*` and `ubuntu-*` environment variants):

* [GNU Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (for `macos-*` runners)
* `apt-add-repository` and `apt-get` (for `ubuntu-*` runners)

## Usage

Add a suitable `uses` step to your GitHub [workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions):

```yaml
jobs:
  install-fish-shell:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Install fish shell
        uses: fish-shop/install-fish-shell@v1
```

## Action versions

Use one of the following patterns when specifying the version reference for this action in your workflow (i.e. the `{ref}` value in `uses: fish-shop/install-fish-shell@{ref}`):

| Pattern  | Example   | Description                                                            |
|----------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `vX`     | `v1`      | the latest `v1.*` release including non-breaking changes and bug fixes |
| `vX.Y`   | `v1.1`    | the latest `v1.1.*` release including bug fixes                        |
| `vX.Y.Z` | `v1.1.0`  | the `v1.1.0` release only                                              |

> [!TIP]
> The recommended pattern is `vX` (e.g. `v2`). This will ensure that the version of the action used in your workflow includes the latest non-breaking changes and bug fixes, and guarantees compatibility with previous versions of that major release number.

Using a `main` branch reference in your workflow is _not_ recommended as this branch may include breaking changes intended for the next major release.
